## My process

### Built with

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I've learned to use <details>, <summary> and <hr> tags to make an accordion without js.
I've practice a bit more of mediaQueries.
I've learned the use of [open] in CSS.


### Continued development

I need to know more about positioning elements for sure.
